# ARIMA Model for Netflix Stock Price Forecasting

This repository provides a Python implementation of the ARIMA model for forecasting Netflix (NFLX) stock prices.

## Purpose:

* Predicts future Netflix stock prices based on historical data.
* Demonstrates time series forecasting using the ARIMA model.
* Provides a foundation for understanding time series analysis in financial applications.

## Implementation:

* Uses Python's `statsmodels` library to implement the ARIMA model.
* Allows for parameter tuning (p, d, q) based on data analysis.
* Provides functionality for visualizing historical data and forecasts.
* Implements methods for model evaluation (e.g., RMSE, MAE).

## Usage:

1.  Install necessary Python packages (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `statsmodels`).
2.  Input Netflix stock price data (e.g., from Yahoo Finance).
3.  Run the provided Python script (`netflix_arima_forecast.py`).
4.  Specify the desired ARIMA parameters (p, d, q).
5.  Interpret output:
    * The script outputs forecasted stock prices.
    * Visualizations of historical and forecasted prices are generated.
    * Model performance metrics (RMSE, MAE) are provided.

## Key Concepts:

* **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average):** A time series forecasting model.
* **p (Autoregressive Order):** The number of lag observations included in the model.
* **d (Degree of Differencing):** The number of times the raw observations are differenced.
* **q (Moving Average Order):** The number of lagged forecast errors included in the model.
* **Time Series Analysis:** Analyzing data points collected over time.
* **Forecasting:** Predicting future values based on historical data.

## Output:

* Forecasted Netflix stock prices.
* Visualizations of historical and forecasted prices.
* Model performance metrics (RMSE, MAE).
* Information about the parameters used (p, d, q).
